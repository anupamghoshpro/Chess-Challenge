## Calculate the total number of valid 10-key sequences, given these constraints:

- sequences can start at any key
- each subsequent move must be a knight move
- no more than 2 vowels per sequence
- repeat keys are allowed
- no topological wrapping of keyboard
 
For example, BKHOHKBILC is one of the many valid 10-key sequences that meets all the constraints.
 
Your challenge is to write a program that prints the total number of valid sequences.

Keyboard layout:

| A | B | C | D | E |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F | G | H | I | J |
| K | L | M | N | O |
|   | 1 | 2 | 3 |   |
